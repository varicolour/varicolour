# introduction

Hello!
My name is **Hazel**, online I use the username **Varicolour**. You can call me either. This is my github, where I post random programs I make.
I'm currently learning Python, and I originally made this account to document my progress. I'm mostly making small games, and things to do with science/math, because those are the things that interest me.
Always feel free to leave comments or feedback on my things, because I want to learn from the things I upload here!
